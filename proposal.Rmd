### Project Description
This is a written, non-technical description of your project.  Depending on the specifics of your project, you should outline the answers to these (and perhaps other) questions:

What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.

Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset.  You should hone in on one of these audiences.

What does your audience want to learn from your data?  Please list out at least 3 specific questions that your project will answer for your audience.

### Technical Description
This section of your proposal is an opportunity to think through the specific analytical steps you'll need to complete throughout the project.

How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?

What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?

What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)

What major challenges do you anticipate? 
Not required, but optional: what questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?Project Description
